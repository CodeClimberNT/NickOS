# NixOS-nick

### First installation of NixOS 

Planning to use this repository to:
- Keep track of my learning history through this amazing OS
- Kind of a Journey Book/Diary
- Have a Backup (I know I'm able to break an unbreakable distro)
- Maybe more ? Idk for now

# First Update 23/08
Already broke it :D
Started in a virtual machine, didn't remember to change boot folder, fortunately NixOS it's hard to break but my need to switch from systemd-boot to grub made me do really dumb stuff that culminate with the deletion of the boot partition for windows :DD <br>
I had no idea what I was thinking: when I saw the first partition with filesystem fat32 I though it would be impossible to be windows <br>
(**REMEMBER** i'm still a noob learning all this stuff)<br>
<br>
I'm doing this because is fun, although nix is not reccomended for new users I though: why not! I already new I would break it, but it's fun learning from my mistake, and i like how many teaching moment I already got through.<br>
<br>
So now I've already created the new boot partition for windows but still wasn't successful to log in (although i got to the first blue screen that show some potential fixes from the os itself), so I'm creating a recovery drive to hopefully repair without losing any data in my main drive (If comes down to it, i will switch to a live system and copy the file over, I'm not this dumb ;P).<br>
I will consider in the future a full linux system, but for now i'm trying with a double dual-boot (both desktop and laptop) to see what can I make of it.
<br>
To the next (hopefully good) Update
